## Nested API Calls

Practice for making multiple API calls from a single event.

### Install

1. Fork/clone this repository.

1. `npm install`

1. `gulp`

Continue to use the linter while you solve the challenge!

### Instructions

You will be building a form with a single submit button. When that button is clicked an API call will fire to two different APIs and build a map based on the location that gets returned.

You will need to hit the following APIs:

| API                         | Purpose
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| https://www.ipify.org/      | Returns the IP address for the current user
| http://ipinfo.io/developers | Returns location information based on an API

For the map, check out [this tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/googleapi/google_maps_basic.asp) on how to embed a simple google map.
